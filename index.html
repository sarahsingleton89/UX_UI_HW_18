                    <p>Hi! I’m Sarah, welcome to my portfolio. Before you check out my work, here’s a little bit about me:
                        The first thing you should know is that I LOVE my 80lb furbaby, Behr. We love to hike, camp, travel, and visit local breweries and restaurants together. 
                        I’m also a musican! I love to sing and jam with friends whenever I have the spare time.
                        Lastly, I love to problem solve. I am detail-oriented, and commited to finding a solution that fits everyones needs as closely as possible. I enjoy creating funtional and beautiful designs- which you will see under my “Designs” tab. If you would like to connect- please head to my “Contact” tab! 
                        
                        P.S- I designed this site using HTML/CSS. I also cannot get the image to work- remind me to ask about that</p>
